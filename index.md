## About me

I've always loved programming **games** and **algorithms**, and I started doing **web dev** about 6 months ago. A couple of my favorite projects are a game called [Joyspring](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1532360/Joyspring/) from 2020/21 and this [UCSD course catalog](https://ucsdcourses.vercel.app) from a couple months ago.
